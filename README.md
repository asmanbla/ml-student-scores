# 🎓 Student Scores - Machine Learning Regression Project
### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Student Scores dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applying Feature Engineering, and developing a Machine Learning Regression Model to predict student scores based on various factors.

### 🔍 Key Objectives:
###### ✔ Gain insights into student performance through data visualization 📊
###### ✔ Apply data preprocessing techniques for better model accuracy ⚙
###### ✔ Implement and compare different regression models 🏆
###### ✔ Evaluate model performance using key regression metrics 📈

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Workflow
#### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
- 📌 Understanding the dataset structure
- 📌 Visualizing data distribution and feature correlations

#### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering 🛠
1. Handling duplicate data
2. Detecting and addressing missing values
3. Performing outlier analysis
4. Splitting data into training & testing sets

#### 3️⃣ Machine Learning Regression Modeling 🤖
We implement and compare two regression models:
- 📌 Linear Regression
- 📌 Decision Tree Regressor

#### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation 📊
Evaluating model performance using key regression metrics:
- 📌 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- 📌 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- 📌 R-squared Score (R²)

#### 5️⃣ Conclusion 🎯
After evaluating the models, we determine the best-performing model for predicting student scores.

#### 🔧 Technologies Used 🖥
- ✅ Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for analysis & modeling
